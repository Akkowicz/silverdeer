                     MODMERGER INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Install Modmerger framework by sphere if you have not already.
2. Add the "trees*.py" files to your main source directory.
3. In the "modmerger_options.py" file add an entry for "trees" under 
   the mods_active section.

That should be all that is needed to compile.  This will install access to this 
troop viewer as the top item in your reports menu.  If you want to change this 
or remove it all together then delete the "trees_game_menus.py" file and install 
your own method to start the presentation "prsnt_faction_troop_tree".
