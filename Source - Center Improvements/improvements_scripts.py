# NOTES ABOUT ADDING IMPROVEMENTS!

# To add an improvement you need to do the following steps:
# 1 - Add a new constant in improvements_constants.py.
# 2 - Add a new entry in script "get_improvement_details".
# 3 - If the improvement has alters rent/tariff income then an entry needs to be added to script "improvement_weekly_income".
# 4 - If the improvement has an upkeep then an entry needs to be added to script "improvement_get_upkeep".
# 5 - If the improvement has special prerequisites beyond cost or center type then an entry needs to be added to script "cf_improvement_can_be_built_here".
# 6 - If the improvement has unique completion benefits then an entry needs to be added to script "improvement_completion_benefits".
# 7 - If the improvement takes longer than the standard cost based time then make an entry in script "improvement_takes_additional_reg1_days".
# 8 - Finally add into the main code whatever the benefits are for the improvement.
