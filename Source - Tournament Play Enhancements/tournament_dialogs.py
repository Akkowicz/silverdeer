# #lord reputation type, for commentaries
# #"Martial" will be twice as common as the other types
# lrep_none           = 0 
# lrep_martial        = 1 #chivalrous but not terribly empathetic or introspective, - eg Richard Lionheart, your average 14th century French baron
# lrep_quarrelsome    = 2 #spiteful, cynical, a bit paranoid, possibly hotheaded - eg Robert Graves' Tiberius, some of Charles VI's uncles
# lrep_selfrighteous  = 3 #coldblooded, moralizing, often cruel - eg William the Conqueror, Timur, Octavian, Aurangzeb (although he is arguably upstanding instead, particularly after his accession)
# lrep_cunning        = 4 #coldblooded, pragmatic, amoral - eg Louis XI, Guiscard, Akbar Khan, Abd al-Aziz Ibn Saud
# lrep_debauched      = 5 #spiteful, amoral, sadistic - eg Caligula, Tuchman's Charles of Navarre
# lrep_goodnatured    = 6 #chivalrous, benevolent, perhaps a little too decent to be a good warlord - eg Hussein ibn Ali. Few well-known historical examples maybe. because many lack the drive to rise to faction leadership. Ranjit Singh has aspects
# lrep_upstanding     = 7 #moralizing, benevolent, pragmatic, - eg Bernard Cornwell's Alfred, Charlemagne, Salah al-Din, Sher Shah Suri

# lrep_roguish        = 8 #used for commons, specifically ex-companions. Tries to live life as a lord to the full
# lrep_benefactor     = 9 #used for commons, specifically ex-companions. Tries to improve lot of folks on land
# lrep_custodian      = 10 #used for commons, specifically ex-companions. Tries to maximize fief's earning potential

# #lreps specific to dependent noblewomen
# lrep_conventional    = 21 #Charlotte York in SATC seasons 1-2, probably most medieval aristocrats
# lrep_adventurous     = 22 #Tomboyish. However, this basically means that she likes to travel and hunt, and perhaps yearn for wider adventures. However, medieval noblewomen who fight are rare, and those that attempt to live independently of a man are rarer still, and best represented by pre-scripted individuals like companions
# lrep_otherworldly    = 23 #Prone to mysticism, romantic. 
# lrep_ambitious       = 24 #Lady Macbeth
# lrep_moralist        = 25 #Equivalent of upstanding or benefactor -- takes nobless oblige, and her traditional role as repository of morality, very seriously. Based loosely on Christine de Pisa
