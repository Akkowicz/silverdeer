# Simple triggers are the alternative to old style triggers. They do not preserve state, and thus simpler to maintain.
#
#  Each simple trigger contains the following fields:
# 1) Check interval: How frequently this trigger will be checked
# 2) Operation block: This must be a valid operation block. See header_operations.py for reference.
